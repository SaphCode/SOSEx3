Hi!

Download somtoolbox+src,
follow http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/dm/somtoolbox/somtoolbox-guide.html
read report,
read exercise sheet https://tuwel.tuwien.ac.at/course/view.php?id=31504
A,B,C 1-4 in progress
to do: C 5-8 & Summary

To get the input data for the somtoolbox, open the notebook with jupyter,
depending on how large you want your input to be (can try normalization too,
commented at the moment), change the num_images (4th last cell),
save the histogram in the last cell under a new name (for report)
and run the SOMTrainer with:
 ./somtoolbox.sh GrowingSOM [path/to/]som.prop // .bat windows, .sh linux
with this readme I'll upload a sample som.prop file, it is also described in report

Analyse with:
./somtoolbox.sh SOMViewer -u /path/to/file.unit.gz -w /path/to/file.wgt.gz --dw /path/to/file.dwm.gz
// the .gz files are generated by training
