Hi!

Download somtoolbox+src,
follow http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/dm/somtoolbox/somtoolbox-guide.html
read report,
read exercise sheet https://tuwel.tuwien.ac.at/course/view.php?id=31504
A,B,C 1-4 in progress
to do: C 5-8 & Summary

To get the input data for the somtoolbox, open the notebook with jupyter,
depending on how large you want your input to be change the num_images (4th last cell),
save the histogram in the last cell under a new name (for report)
and run the SOMTrainer with:
 ./somtoolbox.sh GrowingSOM [path/to/]som.prop // .bat windows, .sh linux
with this readme I'll upload a sample som.prop file, it is also described in report

after training copy properties file you used to the map directory, so we know what settings were used

Analyse with:
./somtoolbox.sh SOMViewer -u /path/to/file.unit.gz -w /path/to/file.wgt.gz --dw /path/to/file.dwm.gz
// the .gz files are generated by training

another important file: (description of som.prop)

guidelines: iterations ~ 100*input samples
size: see report or slides

currently running about 20.000 samples, with 20x20 map,
found someone on kaggle doing 70x70 with 500 samples, ... idk what to do, ill just blindly do slides
